# Heyo!

My name is Noah, but I mostly go under the alias *arcticnoah*.

I'd like to thank you for taking your time to visit! I'm hoping to have my [portfolio](), [daily log](/dailylog) and [blog](/blog) over here.

I am currently focusing on learning multiple aspects of programming, but I also have various other creative hobbies.

Feel free to [contact]() me or check out my [socials]()!
