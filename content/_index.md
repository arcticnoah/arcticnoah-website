# Heyo!

My name is Noah (he/him), but I mostly go under the alias *arcticnoah*.

I am currently focusing on learning multiple aspects of programming, but I also have various other creative hobbies.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact) and thank you for taking your time to visit!

## My Hobbies

I have quite a few hobbies, most of which I'd still consider myself a beginner at, so I currently fall under the term: *Jack of all trades, master of none*.  

In an attempt to change this, I've begun setting myself personal goals/projects to work towards.
  
My current interests include:

* Programming
    * Software Engineering (*Current focus*)
    * Web Development
    * Mobile Development
* Art
    * Traditional
