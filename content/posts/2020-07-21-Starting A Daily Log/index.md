### What is a 'Daily Log'?

A daily log is going to be my version of a diary but with a focus on what I've been up to in the day. I was quite inspired by various development logs, and since I want this to be more of a daily thing and kinda just focus on whatever I've done, I decided to call it a daily log :P

I think having some sort of documentation of the stuff I'm doing, will be both great for me to actually try and work on showing sketches/work in progress drafts/etc rather than scraping them like I currently do, and also have a record to be impressed (or depressed) with, by the amount of work I manage to achieve over a period of time.

I think the main reason I tend to scrap most things I do throughout the day is because I feel things aren't up to my self-set standards and aren't worth continuing, which is honestly a terrible mindset and one that I'm really trying to change as of late. I want to learn to *enjoy the process just as much as the outcome*.

I know its been almost a month again since I last posted but I've actually been quite busy during that time, but nevertheless I'll be trying to post much more frequently :D
