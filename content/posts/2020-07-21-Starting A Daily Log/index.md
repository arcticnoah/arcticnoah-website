### What is a 'Daily Log'?

A daily log is essentially going to be my version of a diary but open to the public (that'll means it'll include less personal details...). The purpose of doing this is that I've been kinda falling behind with staying on track of my projects and also I'd like to document my progress (since I often scrap sketches/work in progress drafts/etc) since it'll help me either be impressed (or depressed) by the amount of progress/work I manage to achieve. I also generally have tend to work on things without really telling others about it and when I finally tell others its kinda a surprise with no real gain of it being a 'surprise'. If anything, its probably slowing down my progress by being 'secretive'/kept under wraps with what I'm doing.
