## TL;DR

So I've decided that from tomorrow onwards, I will be streaming 4 days a week for at least the next 2 months over at [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/arcticnoah).

## Why streaming?

I've always been fascinated by streaming and I've had my occasional periods where I'd try to stream consistently everyday but always gave up on it too soon. So this time, I'm streaming less often but for a longer period of time.

I enjoy the concept of streaming because it lets someone share whatever they want, whether it be playing a video game, travelling the world or showing the process of some creative. It requires some consistency (keeping a schedule) and also encourages entertainment, either from the content creator or the content itself.

## What do I plan to stream?

For June, I'll most likely only be streaming video games as I'll be working on learning the basics of art and music for my [2 current projects](/posts/2020-05-21-first-project-announcements/). My plan is to start playing the Yakuza series (on PC), so I'll be starting off with 'Yakuza 0' tomorrow. I'm really excited to try it since I've heard many good things about it and am going in completely blind!

In July I'd like to start streaming more creative stuff, such as music production and art but it depends on how much progress I make by then :P

## When and where can I join the stream?

I'll be streaming over at [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/arcticnoah), and my current schedule is: *Mon, Wed, Fri and Sat at 7pm UTC/11am PDT/2pm EDT (Without daylight savings).*

Hope to see you all in stream soon!
