## Progress Report

So for the past 2 months since the [initial project proposal](/posts/2020-05-21-first-project-announcements/), I've been slowly making progress in improving my workflow and having a firmer understanding of music production as a whole. I've also generally started experimenting more, especially with sound design. I definitely feel some improvement, which I'm particularly happy about, but as per usual, I'm not quite satisfied with the speed of my progress.

I am still struggling with music theory and arrangement but this is due to me simply not putting enough time and effort into either of these. It will be a focus for me in the next few months, else I will not be producing an EP that I'd be proud of. I will be taking this project more seriously from now, considering that I'm already supposedly a third of the way through it.

## Plans for the remaining time

I will begin planning the EP to a rough idea, and start practising arrangement and music theory daily, since I consider these to be my weaker aspects. I know I claimed that I'd be posting a weekly sketch and that I haven't managed to even post a single sketch yet. I will be trying to actually post sketches from now on, since it'll encourage me to stop throwing away ideas too quickly and also contribute to my arrangement skills. I'll also try to actually post these to communities such as Discord servers for feedback from different perspectives.

I do believe that I can make the goal deadline if I buckle down on working more consistently. As always, thank you soo much for reading! Hope you have a wonderful day!
