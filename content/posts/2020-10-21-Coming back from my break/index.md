So after close to 3 months of silence on this site, I'm finally back! Although I took some time off to try and improve my productivity, I've been pretty busy with finishing off my maths exams, then trying to make a new YouTube video, which you can check out here:

Then having a go at animation for the first time ever:

{{< video src="animation" autoplay="false" loop="true" muted="true" controls="true" caption="The whole purpose of this was to test drive Blender's Grease Pencil feature and try working with it in a 3D world.">}}

I started working on a new music track which I'm hoping to finish off in the next week or so:

And I've started trying to really plan out and develop my game idea which I'm hoping to get into a 'playable enough' state in a week or two (its mostly just fixing bugs at this point!). And in spirit of making a game, I've been playing a bunch of games too, but really impressive and inspiring ones (Yakuza Kiwami 2, NieR Automata and Astral Chain), all with their own unique qualities that I'm trying to take my favourite ideas from!

I've tried to settle on a routine of some sorts but I've decided to just kinda make a list of stuff I'd like to do and do as many as I can without completely burning myself out and so far its been working surprisingly well! This blog post isn't gonna be very interesting but its more just an announcement that I'm back, and hopefully here to stay :D
