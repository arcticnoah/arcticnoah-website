## Reflection of the past month

On the first of this month, [I announced that I'd be streaming 4 times a week](/posts/2020-06-01-beginning-to-stream/), for the next two months. Having now reached 1 month into it, I'm starting to lose enthusiasm for the idea but I'm gonna try my best to reignite my flame.

Out of the 16 "planned"/scheduled streams, I have managed to do 15 (some off schedule to compensate for missed days) streams in the end. All of these have been for the game 'Yakuza 0', which has been an absolute blast and I'm genuinely enjoying every minute of it. I do feel that the game isn't ideal for streaming though, as it has a heavy focus on its story, which requires viewer dedication, which isn't a good idea when I have hardly an viewers in the first place :P

I've found the overall experience to be quite challenging but in a refreshing way, as its improved my reading out-loud skills, speaking my mind in a slightly more structured way (rather than my typical word vomit) and also generally made me more productive, by only playing games during and after stream (for the most part).

## Changes for the coming month

Like I said in my initial post for this goal, I'd like to try streaming creatives but I'm quite scared of having my inconsistent creative process out in the public. However, I'm fairly sure I'll never be quite satisfied with my process, let alone the outcome of said process, so I might as well try again, (I did semi-regular music streams back in September - November 2018) in attempt to combat my mental fear. I would like to continue my gaming streams, but I think my main priority/focus will be creative streams.

I'm also going to change the stream schedule, I currently start from 8pm in my local time, and I get pretty tired after 3 hours since its late for me, so I'm gonna adjust my schedule in a few days to start streaming from around 2pm.

Anyways, thats just my thoughts on how streaming has been so far and what I'm wanting to change in the next month. Here is my [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/arcticnoah) if you'd like to tune in. I'm also gonna blog much more regularly now...

Thanks for reading, I really appreciate it!
