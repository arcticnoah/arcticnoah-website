### Progress Report

So for the past 2 months since the [initial project proposal](/posts/2020-05-21-first-project-announcements/), I have made practically no marginal progress. I truly hate to have to admit this, but I've just been procrastinating art in general because I don't seemly enjoy the process of it, especially when I have to start from a blank canvas/scene.

Now I have been doing some things, such as following lesson 1 of [Draw A Box](https://drawabox.com/) and its 250 boxes challenge. [Here is my profile](https://drawabox.com/community/sketchbook/arcticnoah), incase you wanna see it :P I've also been doing some Blender practise, specifically modelling but honestly no where near as much progress as I'd have hoped to make in these last 2 months.

### Plans for the remaining time

So the plan for this project is to play major catchup, because I am not going to have even a draft [animatic](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/animatic) by the goal deadline at this rate. I'll be filling a page of my new sketchbook everyday from now on, it doesn't even matter how good it looks, just so that I at least get in the habit of drawing everyday, as I feel habits make the creative process much more enjoyable once they are formed.

I really don't want to have to push the goal deadline for this project, so I'll hopefully have made much more progress by the next report. Thanks again for having read this!
