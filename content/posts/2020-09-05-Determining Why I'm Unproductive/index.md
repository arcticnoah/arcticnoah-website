For the last few years, but especially the recent months, I've been trying to work on having a more consistent output, yet I consistently fail to maintain one. This has led me to try and identify the key areas that are causing this.

The first one I've managed to identify is: *Routine*, something that has practically vanished from my life in a proper form ever since lockdown started. I've experienced it before during every single school holiday I've had in secondary school and higher, where I'd wake up at 9am and not get out of bed simply because I had no reason to do so. I sadly wish I was more flexible in this regard but for me to be truly productive, I need to have a consistent, rigid routine that I stick to and keep at it for a few weeks till it finally sticks. I'd often have the problem where whenever my school term would start again, it would take a couple of weeks to fully get into the swing of things, only for it to be foiled by the holidays starting again. Evidently I just seem to take a much longer time than most to adjust to a routine but I think it's really vital for myself.

Another thing I'm repeatedly lacking is: *Motivation*, now I've already talked about this one before in [one of my daily logs](/dailylog/2020-08-23/), but that post in summary is:

 - My determination and interest in a subject is constantly fluctuating as I find things that inspire me and grow frustrated with myself for not producing an outcome I'd be happy with in comparison with the inspiration.
 - This can lead me to 'depressive' episodes that last either hours or months depending on the circumstances.

Now, I have been trying to simply accept that I'm not at the level I'd quite like to be at but rather focus on what I am currently capable of and work on taking small steps towards the inspiration.

Which leads me on to my lack of: *Goals*. This is likely the most impactful problem I'm facing right now, since I'm now taking a gap year, which leaves me with the perfect opportunity to potentially really improve at something but since I haven't really had an end goal of some sorts, this is causing me to almost freeze from options on how to spend my time. I want to spend some time figuring out at least some vague ideas of what I want from myself in the coming years, almost like self imposed milestones.

### So now what?

I've tried to keep posting to the [daily log](/dailylog/) for the past month, but I've started to become **very** lazy with it, as it does indeed take some time and effort. That being said however, I'm not willing to give up on it just yet but I will be taking a break from it for a while. I also started a 'Daily Art + Music challenge' for August, but sadly it failed considerably after less than 10 days, partially due to results day here in the UK ruining my confidence in myself but also because I just stopped having an interest in it for whatever reason.

My plan for the coming month is to really knuckle down on improving my productivity, especially since my education is now on the line with my 'retake' maths exams starting in October. I've already set myself up a schedule that I'm trying my best to follow and starting to think about my goals for the coming years.
