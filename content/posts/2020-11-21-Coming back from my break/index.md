So after close to 3 months of silence on this site, I'm finally back! Although I took some time off to try and improve my productivity, I've been pretty busy with finishing off my maths exams, then trying to make a new YouTube video, which you can check out here:

Then having a go at animation for the first time ever:

{{< video src="animation" autoplay="false" loop="true" muted="true" controls="true" caption="The whole purpose of this was to test drive Blender's Grease Pencil feature and try working with it in a 3D world.">}}

I started working on a new music track which I'm hoping to finish off in the next week or so:

And I've started trying to really plan out and develop my game idea which I'm hoping to get into a 'playable enough' state in a week or two (its mostly just fixing bugs at this point!). And in spirit of making a game, I've been playing a bunch of games too, but really impressive and inspiring ones:

- **Yakuza Kiwami 2**
  - The contrast between the main story and the rest of the game is crazy and I love it
  - The dense, open world is really impressive
  - The minigames are way more in-depth than they have any right to be

- **NieR: Automata**
  - The option to replay the story from various perspectives is really interesting and I feel pretty unexplored with video games
  - The combat is really satisfying, yes its pretty simple in general but it has a lot off depth
  - The style this game gives off from its characters, world, UI, diverse gameplay elements is just really appealing to me and feels extra fun to play because of the amount of effort thats been put in

- **Astral Chain**
  - Like with NieR: Automata, the style this game has is just really cool, especially because its running on a less powerful system, but Platinum Games don't let that hold the game back at all
  - The combat is again like NieR: Automata, but even more enjoyable and in-depth

- **Hades**
  - This game is just the definition of fun, everything about this game is really enjoyable and clearly is a labour of love since there is soo much effort put into every aspect of this game
  - The dialogue in this game is really cool since it seems to react to far more inputs than most games even dare to try and the synergies, progression with the dialogue make this even more impressive

They all have their own unique qualities that I'm trying to take my favourite ideas from each of them!

I've tried to settle on a routine of some sorts but I've decided to just kinda make a list of stuff I'd like to do and do as many as I can without completely burning myself out and so far its been working surprisingly well! This blog post isn't gonna be very interesting but its more just an announcement that I'm back, and hopefully here to stay :D
