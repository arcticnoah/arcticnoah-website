## Welcome to the first ever blog post here!  
  
I'm super excited to finally have an actual site that isn't just a simple landing page.

## How did I make this site?

I used the web framework, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the theme, [hello-friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend/), as a basis. I only started using it all today, so I'm very new to it all but I'm really enjoying the possibilities and workflow so far!

Hopefully in the future, I'll be able to create my own personal theme. But this will definitely do for now :3

Oh yeah, I also have my first ever [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AB8lZiqXXE) posted now!

I hope to announce my first project idea(s) soon!

Thanks for checking out my bare-bones site and take care!
