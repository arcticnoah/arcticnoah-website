### Didn't you just announce the same challenge for art?

Yes, I know I just started the daily art challenge today for the rest of the month but I feel pretty stuck with the progress I've made with music in the last month or two, so I decided I'll just do the same kinda challenge (starting from tomorrow) but for music.

### Differences for this challenge

So instead of having a page done each day, I'd like to have a 30+ second song sketch idea. My current workflow with making music is completely random and very inefficient so hopefully having this requirement will enforce me to start saving presets, creating personal sample packs and general optimising the process of just creating.
