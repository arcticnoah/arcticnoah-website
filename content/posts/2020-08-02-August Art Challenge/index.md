### Daily art challenge?

So I've been thinking for quite some time about doing an art challenge one of these months and I decided even tho its the second of August that I'd try doing one now! Essentially the challenge will be to do a single page in my sketchbook for the next month and have a (nearly) finished sketchbook at the end of the month.

### Why now?

I've always admired people who've been able to consistently push themselves to do something creative everyday, so much so that I even tried it with Blender back in 2017 for almost 3 months. The main reason I stopped back then was because I would often leave it too late in the day to actually learn something new, so I'd end up just reusing techniques/assets and I realised I didn't improve pretty much at all during that time so I just stopped (instead of trying to fix the problem...) which I still regret to this day.

Anyways, now its been 3 years and I want to do it again but try to not fall for the same mistake I did last time. Just like when I did it in 2017, I'll be posting everyday my latest outcome as I felt more pressure and reason to actually do it. I was especially inspired by the awesome twitter user, [majorbean_](https://twitter.com/majorbean_/), who just reached [1,000daily art posts](https://dailies.noahmajor.art/) and you can clearly see they're improvement over the past few years. Obviously there is the more commonly known artist, [beeple](https://www.beeple-crap.com/), who inspired me for my Blender endeavours back in 2017.

### So what kind of art?

So I'll be doing traditional art for the sketchbook (mostly likely but hopefully not only drawings), but I'll also try other mediums like digital painting for further practice. I think I'll be focusing on drawing characters, so I'll be learning:

 - Anatomy
 - Colour theory
 - Composition

The goal of this challenge is to actually be able to draw more proportionally accurate people than what I'm currently capable of, so hopefully thats whats gonna happen :)
