### Changing from Google Analytics to Plausible.io

In the 'experimental' branch of the site, I had setup Google Analytics support a few days ago but today, someone introduced me to a rather cheap option called [Plausible](https://plausible.io) that seems much more privacy friendly and doesn't even use cookies (which means less legal hassle)! I quickly setup the tracker script to the header of all the webpages (with a single imported script) and then removed all the previous cookie consent stuff since the site doesn't need it anymore. I feel pretty happy about this swap, since I was already kinda against adding Google Analytics due to the amount of tracking it does which I didn't want to support.

### Starting anatomy practice

So for around 1-2 hours today, I watched some of Proko's amazing videos on [figure drawing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtG4P3lq8RHGuMuprDarMz_Y9Fbw_d2ws). I then did around 1 hour of gesture drawing practise exercise with the website, [quickposes](https://quickposes.com), as you can see here:

I also managed to do 2 pages of the 'bean' practise exercise today, as you can see here:

I later in the day watched the video, ['Iterative Drawing'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0ufz75UvHs) by Sycra, which I found to be a very relatable video on how to approach learning and improving when you're either an analytical or intuitive person. I'd guess I'm around 65% analytical and 35% intuitive but I seem to become much more intuitive later in the day, which I find can beneficial at times.

### The first sketchbook page...

So uh, I didn't manage to do the sketchbook page today... So this means I'm going to have to do 3 tomorrow now! (Since I 'started' this challenge yesterday) I'm still pretty happy with the stuff I did today but I'm still gonna have to up my game to stay on top of it.
