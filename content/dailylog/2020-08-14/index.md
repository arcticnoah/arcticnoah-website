### Yesterday's UK A-Level results day

So, yesterday in the UK was results day for students who were studying for A-Levels, myself included. However, due to COVID-19, the government and Ofqual decided to call off the exams to let our unfortunate teachers help decide our fate. The whole process was already seemingly flawed since we had practically no control anymore over what would happen. Now, just before results day, there was a report that 39% of all A-Level grades had been downgraded from what our teachers had provided, this led to heavy uproar and even managed to revert this in Scotland but not here in England (hopefully this can still change, but it's unlikely given this government sadly).

Anyways, I received my calculated grades yesterday and even though I didn't get a single one of my predictions (out of my 5 grades, most people take 3), I still feel that I got lucky compared to various friends of mine and what I've read online. I did not get very good grades but they're bad to the point where they don't get me anywhere. I had already decided to not attend university this year back in June once various unis had announced their plans for making the first year online-only, yet still require you to get accommodation nearby the uni, which I'm personally not willing to take a loan for.

Now the other horrible part about this whole results situation, only the day before results day, it was announced that the lowest grade you should receive would be what you had gotten in your mocks, which I didn't revise for since I had an EPQ deadline the same week, despite the real deadline being 3 months later. That being said, I believe I got a better grade in all of my subjects in the mocks than what I received yesterday. 

Now the issue is that the online account that had all my data on results like mocks has been deleted already since June, and my school still hasn't sent me my mock results after having emailed them first thing yesterday morning. I understand they probably have a lot of emails to go through but this is entirely their fault and sadly time is pretty precious at the moment. And the real kicker is that asking for an appeal as much as I understand, costs a lovely £111 per subject (I'm not 100% sure on this but damn that's expensive).

Oh and it gets worse if you want to do a 'resit' (air quotes since no one has done any exams), it costs money to do them. And once again, it doesn't come cheap; the computer science exam, which consists of 2, 100 mark papers costs around £90. The mathematics exam, which consists of 5, 100 mark papers, costs probably even more (my school aren't unsure of the exact price currently). And I only have until next Friday to have picked the exams and paid the fee or else I have till next May/June. 

I'm just completely baffled how *any* of this is allowed to happen but I know that the reason for appeals is to reduce 'spam' (even though it's completely their fault for having caused this mess) and for resits its because schools typically pay the fee but most public schools (mine included) are barely surviving with their funds so they can't pay the fee this time (especially because of the volume of people likely to apply for a resit). 

So what is my current plan? I'm still writing emails to my school for potentially doing resits for mathematics (depending on the cost) but in the meantime, I'll be working on my portfolio of projects (which I need to super seriously step up my game with), start revising for my maths exams in October and just figure out a way to get out of this country before its too late. Apologies for the political vent section here but I genuinely find this whole thing ridiculous and simply wanted to get my situation and opinion out there.

### Website

Today I set out to work on some pending todo tasks and I'm glad to say that I managed to fix 6 of these! I did the following changes/fixes:

 - Fix the audio player width of mobile (Live Version)
 - Replaced the 'back to portfolio' breadcrumb on daily log pages when accessed via a direct link (Experimental Version 1.2)
 - Daily log's taxonomies list now looks the same as the daily log list (Experimental Version 1.2)
 - Auto pause other audio players on the page when you play a new one (Experimental Version 1.2)
 - Updated the URL path of the portfolio section to only use '/portfolio/' rather than unique ones per category (Experimental Version 1.2)
 - Improved the build script to adapt to the new portfolio section structure and respect portfolio drafts (Experimental Version 1.2)

These changes took around 3 hours to do but I'm pretty happy with the results as I feel the site is more polished now. I also wanted to style the audio and video player controls to look more consistent across different browsers (especially since chromium/webkit based browsers don't look amazing currently). Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be possible unless you create custom controls via standard HTML/CSS, so I designed a quick mockup in Figma (because why not):

{{< video src="audio-control-concept" autoplay="true" loop="true" muted="true" controls="false" caption="Audio player mockup made in Figma" >}}

I'll begin working on the working, code version of this tomorrow and I'm also starting to finalise version 1.2 of this site, so that's exciting!

### Nintendo Switch Controllers

So I've owned a Nintendo Switch since December 2018 and I've been absolutely loving it. I've been trying my best to keep it clean and generally looking after it, but just like various other people, I eventually started to have the infamous joy-con drift back in late 2019. I tried to fix it without buying anything but I eventually decided to buy a fake Pro Controller of AliExpress for around £18. Its been working great, especially for the insane price point up until May this year, when the left joystick started drifting as well.

This led me to try fixing my joysticks rather than buying new ones (since the genuine controllers are £60 each!). I ordered some joystick components for both the pro-con and joy-cons. The pro-con had a soldered joystick component that proved to be difficult to remove with my gear but after around 5 hours of work (a month ago or so), I managed to fully repair it! 

I had been waiting for the joy-con joysticks to arrive until today when I finally could fix them, only to find that 1 of the 4 screws to open the joy-cons were stripped (scrapped away to the point when its practically impossible to unscrew them). I feel incredibly unlucky that this has happened, I tried various techniques to overcome it but I'm kinda stuck what to do now. I'll try looking for more answers tomorrow but I'm pretty bummed about it :(

### Art and music practice

I didn't do anything productive yesterday due to the results day ruining my day from an emotional standpoint and also requiring a lot of work to be done with filling forms and constant back and forth with my school via emails. I'm going to continue again tomorrow with much more practice.
