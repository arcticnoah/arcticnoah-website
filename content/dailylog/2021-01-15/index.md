## Artwork progress

Decided to try and finish up the artwork today, so heres the progress I made today:

{{< image src="artwork-iterations.gif" caption="The first frame is were I left off yesterday. I think its coming along together now!">}}

The steps I took today were to rotate all the text elements so that its easier/more natural to read than before. Then I added a few more elements to the geometric 'gradient' before exporting it to Photoshop. I then loaded up Blender to try and replicate this effect:

{{< image src="background-reference.png" caption="Background reference I found online." >}}

My version of the effect is somewhat similar, but overall a bit more simplified since my system couldn't quite handle using 1000s of meta-balls to replicate the 'blob' connections between the points, present in the reference.

{{< carousel-end dots="true" caption="Variations of the same Blender shader." >}}

{{< image src="blender-nodes.png" caption="Blender shader view showing the node tree for the above outputs." >}}

I then used these as texture overlays for the background and geometric shape in the middle. Finally I added a subtle glow to everything but the background.

## Setting myself a routine

The past few weeks have been pretty rough for both my output and mental state (well they are closely related...), but especially the past few days this week, and I don't want this to continue any longer so I've set myself a loose routine of things that should be done every day and a suggested order/timings to keep me on track. I'm planning to ease myself into it starting from tomorrow but I've already slightly failed since I'm staying up later than expected preparing this daily log post :P

Well at least it's something productive!
