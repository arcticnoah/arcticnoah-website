## Trying to finish off the render

So since I had more a usable internet connection today, I tried my best to finish off the render that I've been working on for a little while now. The main things I wanted to change from last time was: 

 - "Add some more details to the walls (like posters) as they're fairly plain."

Now I already knew I wanted to have some more digital posters on the wall, so I spent (the majority of today) trying to create some designs but only really came up with one good one:

{{< image src="poster-design1.jpg" caption="Poster Design 1" >}}

The other two are much simpler and less interesting so I made sure to not keep them too visible in the composition to better disguise their faults.

{{< image src="poster-design3.jpg" caption="Poster Design 3" >}}

For this third poster design, its actually the same texture as the one used for the main digital billboard but I changed the colour palette and didn't add text since it'd be mostly off screen.

The next thing I wanted to add were some air conditioners, so I watched [Ian Hubert's lazy tutorial on it](https://youtu.be/Plw03MczF5s) and ended up with this from the following texture:

{{< image src="aircon-texture.png" caption="Texture for the air conditioner (low res preview)" >}}

{{< image src="aircon-model.png" caption="Simple mesh to create a semi-convincing air conditioner" >}}

Its honestly not a very good source texture for what I was going for but it worked well enough in the scene so I didn't change it in the end.

I rendered out the new additions and slightly changed the compositing to add more clouds to the right side of the sky and add some reflections of the billboard to the pasted structure on the left.

And there we have it. I think this render has reached its limit from me so I'm gonna leave it at that. I'm pretty happy overall with the outcome, some things are not quite right/properly done but generally I'd say this might be my best render yet!
