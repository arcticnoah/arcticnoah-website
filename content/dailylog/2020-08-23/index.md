## I hardly ever have 'real' motivation

Firstly, I didn't mean to take a 3 day break from the daily log but I just haven't achieved or even really done anything on those days. I managed to keep my maths revision up and streaming but thats pretty much been it. I've been thinking about this for the last few years and I'm no closer to really coming up with a way to deal with it, but I simply have no motivation to really do anything for the last 3-4 years. I used to be pretty excited to do things like playing video games, creating stuff (even if it wasn't amazing), relaxing when I felt tired, yet nowadays I struggle with working up the energy to just do things.

It pretty much influences my whole life now, for example, getting up early is a real struggle since I know that once I'm up, I probably won't be starting off with something productive, despite myself being aware that I'm more productive in the morning. Going to bed often happens many hours later than I wanted/should simply because I don't feel I've done enough in the day but rather than trying to get up early the next day, I just 'sulk' over it for far too long. Even right now, its the early evening and I've tried to do things but because they didn't work out quite how I wanted, I've almost given up for the day on trying anything else, which annoys me beyond belief.

I am aware of how this all works in my brain however, I've tried to create a diagram of my (self-destructive) mental process for the last few years:

If I had to guess how long the positive mindset can last, if it wouldn't have been for the past 6 months, I'd say probably a week at most. Yet surprisingly, the lockdown has actually allowed me to maintain an overall, more positive mindset, lasting sometimes a full month! On the contrary, I have had the negative mindset last over a year back in mid 2018 till late 2019/early 2020 (I did have some positive moment buts overall it was very negative).

At the moment, I feel like I'm entering the depressive state and I'm doing everything I can to try and prevent that by continuing to make stuff, despite my lack of motivation but it almost feels like its making it worse.

## Vent over, what've I done today?

I worked on the site some more today, I improved some styling stuff such as a new 'darker' dark theme, updates to the audio player widgets, improved hovering for the portfolio section and a selection colour 
(left is the original, right is the new version!):
