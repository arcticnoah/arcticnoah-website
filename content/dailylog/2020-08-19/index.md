## Rearranging my room

After having planned my potential room rearrange yesterday, I tried to try it out today and after around 4 hours of cleaning all of my dusty surfaces (my room is insanely dusty, my table that I de-dusted this morning is already starting to accumulate dust after only 12 hours...), sorting through all my school notes and documents, moving tables around and rewiring all my peripherals (I make it sound like a lot, its not thankfully), it was finally done. And I'm not too sure if I like it in the end :P I'm fairly sure I always feel like this after reorganising my room but its been almost 2 years since I last did it so I got pretty used to my setup but I think this was for the better now (even if I felt tired for the rest of the day afterwards).

## Productivity status

I kept up with my habits, except the ones for the 'daily' challenge today which is good. Tomorrow I'll try to do my planned art and music session again since I already feel more confident and I really need to stick to the routine of it all.
