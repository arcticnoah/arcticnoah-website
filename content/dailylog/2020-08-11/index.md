## Art practice

I did 10 'gesture' drawings today and a page of robo-beans:

I started following this '[tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8OPmP75HJU)' by Jordan Grimmer on how to make a concept art piece of a landscape. I've only managed to get a minute into it since I'm trying to do this with Clip Studio Paint, which I only recently got and I haven't used before so it took a little bit of getting used to.

## Music practice

So today I started to watch some of Frequent's [sound design videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz5i4zcrOsfWN218LT4jhjwhhMly4Z16n) (the first 4) which I found to be really educational in terms of what features like Ableton's sampler and granulator are capable of. I tried making some grains which you can hear here:

After doing this, I tried playing around with some other Max4Live devices and decided to try making some of my own devices. I tried to create a dial 'math' device that would (for now) add 2 input dials and allow you to map the output to any mappable parameter. This was meant to work with M4L devices such as 'LFO' or 'ReEnveloper' and allow for the combination of multiple 'sources' into a single mappable parameter (since thats not possible). I followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coh80Y0n4A8) and I got this mostly working apart from the second dial not updating the output until the first dial is updated (no clue why this is the case) and sometimes the mapped parameter would only go up to 1% instead of the intended 100% range.

## Productivity report

So I've been keeping this to myself for a while, but quarantine has been an absolutely blessing and curse at the same time. I won't get into too much detail here since I'll probably make it a blog post at some point but a quick summary is that I've been dealing with some sort of depression for quite a few years now and last year was probably my worst year in terms of mental state. Late last year and early this year I was actively working on improving my mindset in general to be more positive and try being more productive but quarantine has slowly been bringing my mindset back to what it used to be.

So to try and prevent it from getting much worse, I decided to create an actual 'schedule' of 'work' hours with the rough timings of when I should be working. I know its pretty ambitious and I'll be happy if I even achieve half of the stuff on this but I think its a pretty good guideline to have.

{{< image src="august-work-schedule-idea.jpg" caption="I do around 10-25% of this currently so this would be a really ideal improvement" >}}

We'll see if I manage to stick with this and for how long... I'm gonna try my best to really stick with it because I want to get better at both music and art and this would help me achieve this by being consistent and focusing on improvement and also just enjoying each one (ideally).
