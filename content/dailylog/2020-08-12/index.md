### Art practice

Today, I sadly did the bare minimum of just 6 gesture poses, from [quickposes](https://quickposes.com). This time I made a real focus on ensuring they are visualising the gesture rather than what I was doing before which was contour lines essentially. I am still working on my linework to be less 'scruffy' and rather use singular, continuous lines. I also did these in 2 minutes rather than what I usually do, which was 3.

I watched a bunch of Youtube art vidos today whilst it was unbearably hot in my room (could've used the time to do art elsewhere...), specifically Proko's really insightful 'Asking Pros' series of videos with many artists that I already admire and their various pieces of advice. I watched around 5 of these and now feel much more guided in what direction I should be taking my studies from now on. I also watched the video about Peter Han's approach to imaginative drawing, which was very inspiring and insightful, demonstrating his thought process and that its not some sort of witchcraft (well I'm still not sure on that one :3 ).

### Music practice

Yesterday I watched all of Frequent's sound design videos that applied to me (so all of them except the Phase Plant one), so I decided to try and achieve what he did in his [Serum tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG8e4EYXJsM) from memory and managed to make some pretty interesting sounds. Sadly these didn't vary as much as his did but its a good start.

I decided to also watch his first [arrangement tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbMSYCFCVSU) which I found really useful as a basis and reminder of how to start an idea. Here is my version of the outcome from his video:

I tried to add a halftime section, but its firstly not actually half time and I feel its a little to abrupt to the groove of the track. I might try to add some more elements before triggering the halftime segment and remove said new elements to create more 'impact' and obvious change.

I also found a '[tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfCazYfl808)' on a different granulator synthesiser called 'The Mangle' and I really loved the sounds it produced so I got the demo and gave it a go myself:

### Productivity report

So I decided to watch some videos from my backlog from 'The Futur' about [Ikigai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2SqqjRn_c0) (how to find 'work' that you love) and [time manangement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxdk27u9UwM). These were pretty good (although a bit too long for me but I understand it was to hammer the point home and they were both livestreams). I have come to the realisation (for like the 900th time :P ) that I waste most of the hours I have pretty much on a daily basis which is not good at all, especially since I do have a lot of free time...

And to make sure I'm not just downplaying myself (and also since it was recommended in the video above), I'll be trying my best to time track myself for the next week or so, to try and encourage less wasteful activities (like Youtube for the msot part) and excessive gaming.
