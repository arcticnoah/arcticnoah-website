### A few updates on the site

I decided to make some slight UI changes to the site, such as removing the drop shadow on elements since it felt like it was actually making elements more unclear. I also adjusted the margins between the images/audio elements and the captions to be more consistent. I decided to add an [image zoom library](https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom/), since it'll be useful for the portfolio section in the future as it lets you see the images at a higher resolution.

### Productivity status

And thats kinda all I did today, I tried for a couple hours to make some music and it just didn't really work out too well. I've decided to get an early night and try to take the next week more seriously. I'll also try to roughly time track the next week to encourage myself to make better use of the time and also to have a proper insight to where my time actually goes.
