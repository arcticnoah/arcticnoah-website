Today didn't involve much creativity but more just research into various self-help topics, specifically why I slept badly last night. I woke up at around 3am and couldn't fall asleep for nearly 2 hours from sweating, despite it having being around -1 degrees outside with my window wide open. Once I did eventually fall back, it was all okay but I feel like my energy levels have been on a steady decline for the past few weeks and last night felt terrible. It seems like I'm doing most things right apart from having a regular bedtime + wake up time and also my use of screens before bedtime is probably not ideal as I do use a blue light filter from around 9pm on my desktop and phone but that's not good enough.

I decided to watch episode 2 and 3 of [Noclip's awesome documentary series about the development of Hades](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-THgg8QnvU4JEVov1tMlFThNYS92F8uC) and grew to appreciate the game even more so than before. The game is honestly soo good and although I'm not very good at the genre , this one feels the most fun to play in almost every aspect and I just can't believe how much love, sweat and tears has gone into this game by a small but insanely impressive team. Honestly, if I'd ever get into game development professionally and be able to work for a studio like Supergiant Games, I'd be pretty damn happy with my life.

In an attempt to be more productive, tried imitating a standing desk setup today with various boxes I had lying around but unfortunately failed as I don't have anything stable enough to support my monitor at my standing height without feeling like it might topple over. I made a list of books that I'd like to read some what soon, many programming/game design related but also some self-help books since I want to better myself as a person. I wrote down some habits I'd like to develop this year, such as: Doing this daily log, trying to do an hour of music production and some form of art every day, practice guitar, learn to sing, regular home workouts and online socialising.

Shortly after that, I rediscovered [a327ex's blog](https://github.com/a327ex/blog), who created a [tutorial series](https://github.com/adonaac/blog/issues/30) about their game [BYTEPATH](https://store.steampowered.com/app/760330/BYTEPATH/), that I've been meaning to try for a while, but they also recently (at least to my knowledge...) started a [daily log (scroll to the section called 'devlog')](https://a327ex.github.io/), which I found pretty awesome as an inspiration of interesting and plentiful amount of content covered in some of them. They linked both [this video](https://youtu.be/wb22xeh_VqM) and [article](https://howtomarketagame.com/2021/01/04/happy-2021-you-are-going-to-finish-a-game-this-year/) and I found these to be a pretty big kick for me to finally settle on a project idea, just go for it and see what happens soooo here goes...

## My main 2021 goal will (likely) be...

My main 2021 goal will (likely) be to create and release a game by the end of the year.

I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this since it's still very early stages and I have a tendency for talking the walk more than I'd like to admit. I will say though, that I've been thinking it through and I genuinely think this might be feasible if I really really put my heart and soul into it. I think I'm almost afraid to admit it but, I really do love video games, not to the point were I play them for hours and hours on end (I do regularly play around 1-2 hours a day though), more for the experiences I get to have with them, particularly the really impressive and impactful ones. And for the last few months now, as I've played more and more games that I'd consider to be some of my favourites, I've had a growing desire to have a real go at trying to make my own unique experience.

I'm not expecting to create anything industry/ground-breaking, heck I'm not even expecting to make a particularly good game (especially since it would be my first) but regardless, I want to have an honest attempt at trying to tackle making one and just see what happens. The goal is to release the game, purely for the reason that it would force me to actually **finish** making the game to some degree, as I also have a habit of not finishing projects that I start, so hopefully this will prevent me from relying on that bad habit.
