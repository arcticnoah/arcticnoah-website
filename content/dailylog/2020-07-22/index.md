### Heyo, welcome to the *first* daily log!

So today I've been mostly doing some maintenance on this very site by organising the Github repo, which is private currently, but I plan to make it public soon!

I've updated the repo's readme to be more informative and polished, as the one before was **very** temporary.

I also added this daily log section today! It took a bit of work since I copied stuff over from the portfolio section (which is hidden whilst I have no content for it) but realised that the code wasn't fully finished yet.

After figuring out the major quirks with them, I think they're in a pretty usable and polished (enough) state. There are some changes I'll be making to them eventually but they're not top priority. I also tweaked/fixed some other pending issues that I noticed today, so overall the projects in a better state than before!
