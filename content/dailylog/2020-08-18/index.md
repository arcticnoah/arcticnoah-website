### Just a quick update on myself

So, I've been having a rough last few days. At first I didn't pay too much attention to my results that I received on Thursday but it had been catching up to me, especially yesterday evening/this morning as it was announced that we'd be getting grades that our teacher predicted (I was worried as it could lower my grades).

Thankfully, I didn't have to wait very long as I received the new grades in the early afternoon and I managed to get an increased grade in almost all of my subjects (all except maths...), so I've decided that I'll just do a retake of maths in October, which I've already started revising for since 2 days ago. I started streaming today again (although it was only Yakuza 0 again) but I hope to keep consistently doing it again since I find it pretty damn fun and provides more of a routine.

### Recreating my room virtually

For whatever reason I can't seem to remember, I decided this morning that I wanted to rearrange my current room to just have a bit more sense of change and maybe even make the room feel more spacious.

To do this, I came up with the idea to test out some layouts virtually (within Blender) rather than actually moving around my stuff until I was happy. I quickly measured the rough sizes of all the key objects and I think Iâ€™ve come up with a pretty good new layout that is similar to my current setup but just slightly rearranged.

I'm planning to rearrange my room tomorrow morning and hopefully I didn't mess up any measurements as its already pretty tight in the virtual version.

### Productivity status

I think the last weeks (and the last few months if I'm being honest) have been pretty unproductive. I've time tracked for the last 2 days, I'll try to keep it up for the next week and then try to analyse it a bit more. I have been slowly getting back on track, especially after getting the good news with my grades, so heres hoping I can keep it up :)
