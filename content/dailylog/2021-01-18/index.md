Today was rather uneventful as all I really managed to do was fix some more bugs in the game that I could find and start working on the itch.io page for it. I managed to finish all of the Noclip documentary on Hades that's been released and I'm feeling really hyped to just try making a proper game but I still have my doubts if I'll even manage to make a super simple playable game honestly.
