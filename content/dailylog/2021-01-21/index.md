So today's finally the day huh... I actually published [my itch.io page](https://arcticnoah.itch.io/2d-tactics)! I sent it off to one friend just to make sure it's working, and seemingly there was a problem as they couldn't even manage to run the game for longer than 10 seconds. Strangely however, the game started working when they screen-shared themselves trying to run the game, so I have no clue what might've been causing it but ehhh its fine now I guess `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`. I'll likely send the demo out to some more friends soon just for some general feedback.

I also managed to settle on an initial version of the game design document for my game idea so far. I'll not be revealing much info apart from it being a continuation of the current game demo. Despite it currently being flawed, I still really want to try making a tactics-like game but this time I'll be porting and refactoring the code entirely in Unity, starting from tomorrow.
