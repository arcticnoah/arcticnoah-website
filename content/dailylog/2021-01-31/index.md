Today I received an email that my Github Education benefits have expired and for some reason, I decided to use the moment to prepare the website's private repo for a public release. This wouldn't really require much effort on my part but I decided to try finishing off some pending tasks, such as improving the portfolio build script to only (re)render the changed portfolio pages GIFs. I also improved the script's output to look more visually appealing.

There seems to be a problem with GIFs that don't need to be updated sometimes being removed but I'll fix it tomorrow.
