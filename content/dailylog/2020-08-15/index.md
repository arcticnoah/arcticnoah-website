## New features for the site!

So I've been working for a few hours today on the custom audio player for the site and finally got all the functionality I wanted for this first version in. I will eventually add a loop button and also port it over for videos too. Here is a working example:

{{< audio src="/audio/portfolio/2020-08-august-daily-music-challenge/sounds/2020-08-15_1.mp3" caption="A slightly updated version of the sketch I made 3 days ago" >}}

Pretty happy with the result and I used this [codepen](https://codepen.io/hossein_ghanbari/pen/eYYKJXd) as a reference, especially since it had zero dependencies which greatly reduces the size of the site (and encourages me to actually learn new stuff).

I also added 'embla-carousel' to the site as a feature for collecting various images (such as the gesture drawings) into a single space and also to create more pretty portfolio sections.

{{< carousel-start >}}
{{< image src="/img/portfolio/2020-08-august-daily-art-challenge/drafts/2020-08-11/gesture-page1.jpg" slide="true" >}}
{{< image src="/img/portfolio/2020-08-august-daily-art-challenge/drafts/2020-08-11/gesture-page2.jpg" slide="true" >}}
{{< image src="/img/portfolio/2020-08-august-daily-art-challenge/drafts/2020-08-11/gesture-page3.jpg" slide="true" >}}
{{< image src="/img/portfolio/2020-08-august-daily-art-challenge/drafts/2020-08-11/gesture-page4.jpg" slide="true" >}}
{{< carousel-end dots="true" caption="These are from 2020-08-11 and are just to demonstrate the new feature" >}}

I will try to make the styling look more interesting as at the moment there is no drop shadow since it didn't work correctly with the way its setup. I'd also like to add an option to add captions as an overlay on the image.

## Productivity status

So once again, I didn't do any art/music (at least nothing substantial enough to put here) and yes I have been working on the site but I feel like I have been putting it off unfortunately, so tomorrow I'm just gonna get to it as early as possible.
