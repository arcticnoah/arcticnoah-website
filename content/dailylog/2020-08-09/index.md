## Anatomy practice

I did the 6 'gesture' drawings but I really focused on making them as good as possible by correcting mistakes (without spending forever on them) today:

I should've done more of these and either make some progress on the Proko course or doing previous segments exercises...

## Other art stuff

I tried to finish off my Draw A Box Lesson 2, texture analysis page but I only managed to finish 1/3 of the gradients required today.

I also redid yesterdays drawing in pen and also tried to draw a train station with reference (again its mostly copied but I did make some slight variations).

## Productivity report

I seem to write these a lot lately... So today I spent around 3 hours on art which I'm quite surprised by, mostly with how that single textured gradient took 1 hour to do surprises me. I was watching 'Ponyo' whilst doing it but I guess I underestimated how distracted I got. Distractions are generally the main reason of my low output and its something I really need to try and combat since it is an issue. I need to learn to do work without having music or films and just solely enjoy the process of creating.

I think from tomorrow onwards I'll set out to do 2 hours of new study a day (for both art and music individually) since I still feel I need to learn more currently than put knowledge into practice.
