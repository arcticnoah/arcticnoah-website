## Learning a lower level programming language

Today during my long session of procrastinating, I found an interesting game engine/framework called [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) that uses the language, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I already was aware of what the language was, but I decided to look into it a bit more and this led me to find out about [Godot-Rust](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust) and also to finding in general what an awesome language it is.

Now, I've been meaning to try learning a more low level programming language than what I'm currently familiar with, with C# being the lowest level language I know. I decided to try out Rust upon todays research, as I've heard many good things about it, specifically that it still encourages you to manage garbage, enforces various very good programming design choices and is very fast!

That being said, I've also seen that it has a pretty steep learning curve and thats understandable due to the way its been designed but it's seemingly worth it and most likely will make me better at programming in general.

I managed to go through the first 2 chapters of the official Rust Book, when you're walked through how to setup rust and then creating a console version of the guessing number game. I decided to stop there since I wanted to spend some time doing other things. 

## Messing around with Blender

I tried setting up a natural environment render quickly with the Scatter and Grove addons for Blender and managed to create this:

{{< image src="blender-scene-preview.jpg" caption="Here is the scene from the viewport" >}}

{{< image src="blender-render-preview.jpg" caption="I wanted to do a proper render but I don't have enough RAM to do so..." >}}

I had setup a simple mist setup so that the background would be covered in mist but that was only done via compositing and since I can't render, its not present in the render preview :(

## New art supplies

I ordered some new art supplies for myself that I'd been wanting for a while. I got the follow today:

 - *Pentel Ink Brush Pen* (seen some awesome art using these kinds of pens and this one was relatively inexpensive and should be good enough to try learning it)
 - *Sakura Mechanical Pencil 0.7mm* (used to have a Muji mechanical pencil but I ran out of the refills and decided to get a more 'artist' focused mechanical pencil)
 - *Kneadable Rubber* (never tried one of these, I've heard good things about it tho)
 - *Soft Rubber* (since I only have my rubber from school, which is honestly pretty crap)
 - *A5 20 page sketchbook* (currently only have an A4 sketchbook and I find the size of the pages a bit too intimidating but A5 seems much more manageable and it was a cheap purchase)

I gave the pen brush a short go today and absolutely love it already, its super fun to use and I love the various textures and line weights you can get with it! Gonna continue the art + music stuff tomorrow, I promise!
