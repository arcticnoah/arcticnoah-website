So today was very difficult for me, I woke up with one of my wisdom teeth being to rupture, so I've been experiencing an incredible pain, that's only been getting worse throughout the day. I tried to work on the game today, mostly focusing on restructuring the current code to be more scalable and offer better features but after a few hours I just couldn't manage to work anymore.

I ended up just taking it easy today but even my usual occupations such as watching videos and playing video games were too much for me today. Hopefully tomorrow will be less painful...
