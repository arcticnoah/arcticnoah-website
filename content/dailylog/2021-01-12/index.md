Long time no see! Hope everyone had a winter holiday and a happy new year! I've finally decided that its time to give this daily log a second go, so here we are!

I decided to work on the website a bunch today and I managed to get a hand full of changes finished such as the inclusion of simulating hover actions on mobile/tablet devices via the use of the [intersection observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API). It's typically used for lazy loading images (which I'm planning to support soon) but I realised it would work pretty well for 'hovering' over elements that are in full view. I also managed to adjust some aspects of the portfolio section, making it less of a hassle to navigate and understand. Various bug fixes were also made and simple styling updates.

The main focus of the day was publishing the first pieces of content to the [portfolio](/portfolio) section of the site and I managed to finish both of my [sixth form education projects](content/portfolio/sixth-form-education) so I'm super happy about that. I plan to add this website itself to the portfolio section and also a release of my first ever video game soon.

Sadly thats all I was really up to today (other than playing online with some friends and procrastinating)!
