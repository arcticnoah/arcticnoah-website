## What does my current routine look like?

So I've been reading and watching a bunch of creatives from different backgrounds and a common thing I've noticed is that they all have some kind of routine that encourages them to try and create something everyday. Now this isn't anything new to me, but I think especially today, I came to the realisation that I simply don't do this enough. In fact, my current routine just *doesn't exist*.

## What would an ideal routine be?

Well I'm not sure there is a single routine that would work for everyone but what I've commonly seen are mostly routines that:

 - Encourage learning new ideas/techniques/etc.
 - Practise of the already learned aspects.
 - Experimentation to explore the learned aspects further.

Another thing I noticed, specifically with creatives, is that people wouldn't allocate time to have a 'polished' output every set time frame because its rarely possible to create a 'work of art' on demand, at least not to that extent for most people (myself definitely included).

I've tried to spend a large amount of the day thinking about generally how I structure my day and I think my main problem is that I spend more time idolising the idea of actually doing work more than just doing it (just like Nike and [Shia LaBeouf keep saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0)).

So I'm gonna *just do it*... from tomorrow onwards hopefully ;)
