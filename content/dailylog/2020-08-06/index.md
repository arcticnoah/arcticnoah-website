## Not coping with the heat

So today was around 33 degrees celsius outside, around 75% humidity and with my computer gets pretty hot (I probably don't have enough fans in it...) and my room having terrible ventilation (basically none), it was far too hot in my room to try drawing since my hands were sticking to the paper and I barely could focus. I know it sounds like I'm constantly making excuses and I genuinely did try to draw or generally use my computer today but it was far too hot. I'll try to make the most of the morning from now one, since its cooler whilst it definitely got warmer (and more humid) towards the afternoon till late night.

## Trying out storyboarding and story planning

So I headed out into the local woods were it was much cooler for about 2-3 hours but only brought my notebook with me. I decided to use the time to try doing my first ever storyboards and super rough story planning for my short film project, which is the reason why I'm trying to improve my art skills to somewhat achieve my vision.

I'll be honest, I had no clue what I'm doing and its super hard to read or even understand what my storyboard is trying to communicate but I understand whats meant to be happening so at least its good enough for me :P

I also tried some story planning but didn't really get too far as I wrote the plot for the current frames I had created from the storyboard but didn't really think much further than that from a plot perspective.

Once I got back from the woods, I watched a great video by Tyler Mowery, called '[How to Write a Short Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMqIQcTMlA0)', which I feel explained how to write a good plot very well and also had a great example short film to compliment and demonstrate the points he was making. After having watched it, I feel much more direction in how to approach the story but I still need to figure out a great plot since I don't want to invest a large amount of time into a plot I don't feel much attachment/belief in.

## Making preparations for the daily music challenge

So I did manage to write some rough notes on what I should try and focus on with my music over the next month. I tried a similar schedule to the one I made for the daily art challenge as you can see here:

 - Drum programming practice (August 5th-9th)
 - Music theory practice (August 10th-16th)
 - Sound design practice (August 17th-23rd)
 - Arrangement practice (August 24th-30th)
 - Foley/Instrument recording and usage practice (August 31st-September 6th)
