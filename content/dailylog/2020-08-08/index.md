### Trying to diagnose an old macbook

So I've had an old macbook from 2008 lying around in the house since it stopped working back in 2011/2012 but never really tried to figure out what the problem was. Today I spent probably like 6 hours taking it apart, trying to use a replacement dc port part to troubleshooting with various youtube videos on diagnosing similar problems to what I'm facing.

Essentially the problem is that the original charging port had melted one of the pins, but after having replaced it, the charger would still not show the green light to indicate its charing. I checked various components and I've come to the conclusion that its either the battery since the battery indicator works when the battery is not plugged in, or its the SMC, which would be a pain to replace so I'll likely try ordering a third party battery (since you can't buy new genuine ones of this old model) and if it doesn't work I'll return it and give up on reviving it.

### Anatomy practice

So after having wasted a lot of time on the macbook, I did the 10 'gesture' drawings for today:

### Copying from reference

And because I was being lazy from earlier, I tried to copy [this reference drawing](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzycVXunZ_U/), which has this painterly look that I'm a massive fan of.

I need to learn to draw from inspiration and I know that to do that I need to work from reference but what I've done is not work from reference but rather just plainly copy it.

### Productivity

I am genuinely really disappointed with myself today, since I just simply spent far too much time prioritising the macbook over the art and music challenge. It would've been a better use of my time, even if the macbook would've worked in the end. I do want the macbook to work but it didn't have to be done today and I really need to just work on my priorities and also setting up a more distraction free environment.

I also am aware that I do often rely on excuses for why I didn't manage to deliver somethings like music today or any new progress on the proko course and thats just because I constantly give myself excuses in the moment and I really need to combat this way of thinking because its really eating away my time that I just simply won't be getting back and its not even being 'wasted' on entertaining things all the time like I used to, I just seem to have voids of nothing scattered throughout my day and I need to reduce those first and then the distractions.
