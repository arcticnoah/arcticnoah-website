### Anatomy practice

So I set out to do around 10 gesture draws a day and I think I'll continue to do so for a while (even after this week) since I'm feeling slowly more confident in my line making and general accuracy.

I then watched the next video in Proko's Figure drawing course which was focused on using boxes to create the torso 'bean' which I found significantly more comfortable and 'easier' than the more 'organic'/natural form of the standard 'bean'.

This is most likely because I've done the first lesson of Draw-a-Box and the 250 box challenge which definitely improved my confidence in perspective and general box drawing.

### Music sketch

So today I watched a music course focused on general production despite this week meaning to be focused on drum programming. I tried to apply some of the knowledge from the course into today's sketch which I had an early draft of but decided to reuse it and add more elements to it.

### Sketchbook

So I think its fair to say that its not looking like I'm going to be getting that sketchbook started at this rate so for now I'll just be focusing on studying anatomy but I do still want to try starting the sketchbook maybe next week since colour theory I doubt will take as much time as anatomy.

In my defense tho, today I spent around 2 hours on anatomy and 3 hours watching a music course, then some time on the music sketch and then the rest of the day offline because of the heat. I am almost done with that music course so hopefully once its done I'll have time for the sketchbook perhaps?

### General productivity

I've definitely noticed that my productivity isn't all that amazing as I've been roughly time tracking my days for the past week and I on average spend around 3-4 hours doing productive stuff (fairly sure it was even lower before these challenges) and then spend the rest of the day doing whatever else. Sadly these daily log posts do take quite a large portion of my time, around 15-45 minutes, especially more towards 45 minutes recently (since I have to photo-scan my drawings, crop, perspective correct, edit for clarity and resize them) but I'm not stopping these since it really encourages me to have stuff to show on a daily basis and its a great log to see what I've managed to achieve.

Now since these challenges have started, I do notice that my general attention span towards learning and practice has already drastically improved (likely from the pressure of having to deliver on a daily basis and also taking frequent short breaks) and even if I don't achieve too much by the end of this month, if I manage to maintain my newly improved work ethic I'd already consider that a massive gain!
