I woke up pretty late today as I've been having sleep problems for the last couple months and I tried to catch up a bit on some sleep, causing me to wake up at around 11am.

After finally getting up, I decided to start working on the artwork for my newly finished music track that I hope to release very soon. I used Adobe Illustrator for around an hour before noticing that it was using nearly 100% of my CPU and managed to crash all other programs. I looked into the issue for much longer than I'd like to admit, firstly reinstalling the program, then checking for conflicting programs (you can never know with Windows) and finally online. I'm not sure why I didn't look online first because within seconds of my first search, I found the problem resolved around Adobe's "Core Sync" process, which was causing the drastic spike in CPU usage. After force quitting the process (whilst Illustrator was open), I didn't notice any functionality missing and the CPU spikes were gone! I continued a bit more work on the artwork:

It's pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I have a pretty good idea of how I want it to look, so thats hopefully what I'll be working towards tomorrow.

I also finally cleaned my room a bit as it was quite a bit overdue, so I'm glad I managed to do that. I also played Hades for the first time in 2 months and damn is it such a good game still, like just wow.
