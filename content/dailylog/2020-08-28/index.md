## Update the site to v1.2!

Today I managed to merge the 'experimental' branch into the 'master' (public) branch of the site and that means its now live! Heres a changelog of the update:

- **v1.2**
    - Contact section has been added.
        - Includes a list of my social media links.
        - Email form has been added, lets users send an 'email' to me directly without revealing my email publicly.
    - Image carousels widget has been added.
        - Lets multiple images be present via a slideshow, in a single space.
        - Using the library: [embla-carousel](https://github.com/davidcetinkaya/embla-carousel), to add this feature.
    - Image zooming has been added.
        - Images can be viewed in fullscreen now by clicking/tapping any content image.
        - Using the library: [medium-zoom](https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom), to add this feature.
    - Custom audio player widget has been added.
        - Consistent style across browsers and devices.
        - Has the most common/important features of a browser audio player.

        - Selection highlighting with accent colour.
        - Improved drop shadow by reducing its 'spread' and adjusting it for the dark theme.
    - Small adjustments:
        - Portfolio section stays on the URL path '/portfolio' only now, rather than sometimes using '/categories' (due to Hugo taxonomies).
    - Bug fixes:
        - Fixed some breadcrumb inconsistencies.
        - Mobile scaling should be more consistent now.

## Time tracking analysis

Last week, I managed to track 6 out of 7 days pretty accurately with the tool, [Toggl](https://toggl.com) and I knew they had a CSV export feature but I also found their PDF export feature which includes a nice detailed pie chart and list of how I spent my time those 6 days, as you can see below:

{{< image src="tracked-time-data.png" >}}

As you can see, I spent around 16-18 hours in those 6 days playing video games, which is something I personally expected to be much lower. I only spent around 5 hours doing music, 2 hours in Blender and 1.5 hours watching education Youtube, so in totally around 8.5 hours of productive stuff which is honestly quite disappointing. After having looked at this, I realise that I waste far too much time on meaningless stuff such as watching 'stuff' (Youtube, Netflix, etc) and I should be spending more time focusing on my hobbies, and just take it less seriously in general.

I'm going to try and post more daily again from tomorrow onwards since I feel I'm (finally) out of my personal rut, so here goes!
