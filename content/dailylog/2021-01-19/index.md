So today I had a massive headache/migraine all day which really tired me out at first but after a while I got used to it thankfully. Today I decided to try out a quick idea in Godot, where I use a 2D character in a 3D world, but the camera is still quite restricted like in 2D games. Here's a short demo of the project:

{{< video src="2d-demo" autoplay="false" loop="true" muted="true" controls="true" caption="Video demo of the thing I made today." >}}

The pixel art sprites come from this page on [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/content/zelda-like-tilesets-and-sprites). The camera only moves when the player enters a specific volume, that send properties to the camera, which is interpolates over time to.

{{< image src="volume-view.png" caption="Top-down view of the level with the volumes highlighted." >}}
{{< image src="volume-properties.png" caption="View of the properties set by the volume, that are sent to the camera when the player enters it." >}}

It's nothing crazy but I'm pretty happy with what I learnt with it!

I also started playing **The Talos Principle** today and managed to complete "palace" A (i think that's what they're called) in just over an hour, which is about as far as I got in the first playthrough from 4 years ago, which took me 5 hours to finish :P  

Sadly that's kinda all I managed today partially thanks to my headache but hopefully tomorrow I'll release the demo for my first ever game!
