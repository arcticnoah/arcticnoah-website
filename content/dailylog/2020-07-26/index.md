## Deciding when its okay to take a break

For quite some time now, I've struggled with being cold turkey by either doing work like crazy or doing nothing (seemingly productive) at all. After having kept up with my personal goal of achieving something useful everyday for 4 days in a row and wanting to spend some time with my family, I decided that today I should take it easy and only do some work if I feel like it.

Now I was planning to do some more work on the render from 9pm for an hour or 2 but I had practically no internet as you can see here:

This meant I couldn't try learning how to do 'photo-based primitive modelling' (like what Ian Hubert does in various of his lazy tutorials, if I remember correctly...), so I tried my best to figure it out myself but couldn't seem to figure out the UV projection, so I'll try tomorrow when my internet is hopefully less disappointing.

Thats my excuse for the lack of a proper daily log today :P
