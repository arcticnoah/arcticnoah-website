### Taking breaks once a week?

I'm tempted to make Sunday my one day 'off' from having to work on something since I am already starting to struggle with keeping up with the daily log and now that I've announced I'll be working on a [daily art challenge](/posts/2020-08-02-august-daily-art-challenge/) for the rest of the month from tomorrow, I've been busy preparing for it.

### Preparations for the daily art challenge

So like I said in the challenge announcement post, I'll be making a concious effort to not fall into the same mistake of my first daily challenge, where I'd leave the task too late in the day to actually learn anything. I found some great resources on things I might try to focus on and how to approach learning them. My current 'rough' plan is the following:

 - Anatomy practice (August 3rd-9th)
 - Colour and light practice (August 10th-16th)
 - Value and form practice (August 17th-23rd)
 - Composition practice (August 24th-30th)
 - Perspective practice (August 31st-September 6th)

 I essentially copied the table from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45y275C-NJU) whilst I was looking for ideas of how to improve my art, specifically people/anatomy since I have practically no experience with it. My goal is to get better at art in general but even if I don't improve at all, I'll hopefully have enforced the habit of daily practice into my routine!
